The goal of this project is to write a checkbook balancing program. The program will read in, from the console, the following for all checks that were not cashed as of the last time the user balanced their checkbook:
The number of each check 
The amount of the check 
Whether or not it has been cashed
The class check has a member variable of type Money to record the check amount. Constructors and functions could be found to rad in all the deposits, show the old and the new account balance by reading in from the user at console;cin. 

The program outputs the total of the checks cashed, the total of the deposits, what the new balance should be, and how much this figure differs from what the bank says the new balance is. 

This project highlights the use of Object-Oriented Programming, encapsulation, and overloaded operators.
